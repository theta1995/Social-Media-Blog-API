# Project: Social media blog API

## Background 

When building a full-stack application, we're typically concerned with both a front end, that displays information to the user and takes in input, and a backend, that manages persisted information.

This project will be a backend for a hypothetical social media app, where we must manage our usersâ€™ accounts as well as any messages that they submit to the application. The application will function as a micro-blogging or messaging app. In our hypothetical application, any user should be able to see all of the messages posted to the site, or they can see the messages posted by a particular user. In either case, we require a backend that is able to deliver the data needed to display this information as well as process actions like logins, registrations, message creations, message updates, and message deletions.
